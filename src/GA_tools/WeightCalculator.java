/**
 *
 * runs a genetic algorithm for weight calculation.
 * We have a population of many genetic players
 * Every individual is a genetic player with different weights
 * In every generation, all individuals are split into groups of 4 RANDOMLY
 * Those 4 players play against each other and produce a winner.
 * The winner is stored.
 * All the winners reproduce until a population of the same size is produced.
 * There might be different reproducing strategies, the one we have right now is also random in itself.
 * The previous generation dies including the winners. It is replaced by the new
 * generation formed by the winners descendants
 *
 * We repeat this process for a number of time.
 *
 * Then we will make all those individual play each other until only one is left (that code is still to be written)
