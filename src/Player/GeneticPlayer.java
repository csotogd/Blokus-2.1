            0 p 0
            c 0 c
        If we encounter a position c where c is a player number other then this player, then we check whether
        that player can make a move on p. We do this by checking all of the sides of p (denoted by the 0's).
        If one of those sides is equal to the player number (of the opponent), then this player could not make
        a move on p, and this position is not counted. However, if none of the sides are this player number,
        then the opponent could make a move. If this move would be performed, then this square would be taken.
        So we know that this move blocks a corner and we add 1 to the score.

        This method and checkSides are made so the main strategy method doesn't get too long.

        Maybe you can fix the issues by putting this method in the if statement expression, instead of the
        condition. Then let it return an integer instead of a boolean. Just make a new variable at the beginning
        of this method and set it to 0, and then increment that value everytime you reach a point marked with a *
        Then, at the end you return that variable and add it to the blockCornerNumber

        You still need to find something for when one player has p as a toCorner twice:
        1 0 1
        0 p 0
        0 0 0
        when this happens, this corner would be counted twice (after you fixed the previous problem).
        But you would only block one move from player 1. So it should only be counted once, right?

        Good luck!
